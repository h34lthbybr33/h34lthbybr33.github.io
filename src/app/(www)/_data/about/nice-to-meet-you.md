My name is Bree, and I'm elated to be your dedicated health insurance advisor, ready to navigate the world of health coverage with comprehensive knowledge and ease. I've traded the crisp New Hampshire winters for the vibrant warmth of Florida.

When I'm not enjoying walks on the beach with my crazy pup, Halo, I'm staying up to date with new ways to provide the most comprehensive and affordable coverage for my clients. I specialize in finding health coverage that benefits everyone from individuals to families, and the self-employed!

Making a positive difference in the lives of others is my passion.
