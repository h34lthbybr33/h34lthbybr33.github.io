As the end of the year approaches, it's time to start thinking about your health insurance options for 2025. The open enrollment period is coming up soon, and it runs from November 1 to **December 15, 2024**. This is the perfect opportunity to evaluate your current plan, explore new options, and ensure that you and your family have the coverage you need for the upcoming year.

### Why Open Enrollment Matters

Open enrollment is the only time of year when you can sign up for health insurance or make changes to your existing plan without needing a qualifying event. Whether you have experienced changes in your health needs, added a new family member to your household, or simply want to find a plan that better fits your budget, this is your chance to make those adjustments.

### Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute!

It's important to take the time to review your options during this period. Health plans can change from year to year, including premiums, coverage options, and networks. By being proactive, you can avoid gaps in coverage and ensure that you're making informed decisions based on your healthcare needs.
